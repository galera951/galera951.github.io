            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>
                My name is Gleb, and I'm a student of MIPT. I was born in Pskov and spent my entire childhood there.
                Before MIPT, I studied at the Pskov Technical Lyceum (PTL) and Kvantorium Pskov.
                There I met good people, many of whom we still communicate with.
                In addition, I graduated from a music school in the French horn class.

        <section id="my-interests">
            <h2>My interests</h2>

            <p>
                I am interested in physics and programming, and I am trying to combine these interests.
                Now in my free time I am learning web development, because I am interested in it.
                I also work in the project activity group of the Department of General Physics at MIPT.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes on weekends I travel around Moscow and its environs, and take some great photos.
                You can find some of them on my <a href="https://vk.com/gleblug">VK page</a> or in the relevant
                section on this site. In my free time, I attend the basketball section at my institute.

        <section id="my-skills">
            <h2>My skills</h2>

            <p>
                As I wrote above, I understand something about physics and programming.
                For example, I know Python, the LaTeX markup language and have recently become interested in
                web development, so I will probably soon know HTML5, CSS and Javascript.
                In addition, I have basic skills in creating graphics in Adobe Illustrator, animation in Adobe After Effects
                (you can see my first project in Adobe AE <a href="https://youtu.be/SaNFp8mNNlQ">here</a>, and
                sorry for the bad music :D). Previously, for a long time I was engaged in 3D modeling at Autodesk Inventor,
                now at the institute I have a course on modeling in Solidworks.

        <section id="my-projects">
            <h2>My projects</h2>

            <p>
                You can see some of my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/galera951">GitHub</a>.
                Maybe in the future I will open more repositories, and you will see more of my work.

        <section id="my-achievements">
            <h2>My achievements</h2>

            <p>
                In the first semester of my studies (2021), my friend and I made a project that won the
                <a href="https://mipt.ru/education/chair/physics/vopros-po-vyboru/1-kurs-zima-2022.php">
                Contest of Questions for Choice</a> from the Department of General Physics of MIPT.
                In the future, I plan to participate in various other contests and will keep you informed about my successes!
